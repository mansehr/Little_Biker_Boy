# Little_Biker_Boy

This is a school project developed in Visual Studio 6 during my latest year in
high school. I found it on one of my backups from that time and put it on github
  for better backup security an maintainability.   

The are a number of projects in this repository:
* Config LBB Files - Application to update the game config files.
* Little Biker Boy - The main Application
* Screen - Don't remember but might be a test project
* Work utveckling - code testing and development project

This is a raw copy of how the folder structure was on my computer when we where
done. There is not much of a history since we didn't use any versioning system
at the time.
